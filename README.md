# DS-KNN
KNN is one of the simplest forms of machine learning algorithms mostly used for classification. It classifies the data point on how its neighbor is classified.


## Problem Statement :
	A National Zoopark in India is dealing with the problem of segregation of the animals based on the different attributes they have.
	Build a KNN model to automatically classify the animals. Explain any inferences you draw in the documentation.

## Business Objective : To classify the animals in Zoo based on their physical appearance & features.

## Constraints :  There can be more features & factors to classify the animals.

##  Boolean features	    Non-Boolean features    Description
